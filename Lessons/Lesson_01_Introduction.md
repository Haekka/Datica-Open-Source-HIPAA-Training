Lesson Content:
Summary of Training
This is an overview training of HIPAA, with coverage of key definitions and provisions for the handling of HIPAA-relevant data. The material in this training is intended for individuals who work for organizations that provide technology and technology-enabled services to health systems, payers, physicians, pharma, and other healthcare organizations. It leans more heavily on the use of modern, cloud-based technologies than traditional client side software.

So why is HIPAA training important? The rationale is best explained by this quote from Cory Doctorow -

*We should treat personal electronic data with the same care and respect as weapons-grade plutonium -- it is dangerous, long-lasting and once it has leaked, there's no getting it back.*

The goal of this training is to ensure that you understand the importance (and ways) of protecting sensitive data and apply it regularly both at your work and in your personal life.

Original material and content was created by [Datica Health, Inc,][1] and is released as open source.

Summary of Training
This is an overview training of HIPAA, with coverage of key definitions and provisions for the handling of HIPAA-relevant data. The material in this training is intended for individuals who work for organizations that provide technology and technology-enabled services to health systems, payers, physicians, pharma, and other healthcare organizations. It leans more heavily on the use of modern, cloud-based technologies than traditional client side software.

The training covers the following topics:

* Types of entities HIPAA defines;
* What is PHI;
* How is PHI anonymized;
* Understanding of the various sections of safeguards in the Technical Rule;
* What is a business associate agreement;
* How is risk inherited with different levels of technology;
* What is a breach and how is a breach handled;
* How did the HITECH Act change HIPAA;
* What is expected of workforce members with access to systems that store PHI;
* What are the sanctions for knowingly violating HIPAA;
* How does Datica address compliance.

So why is HIPAA training important? The rationale is best explained by this quote from Cory Doctorow -

*We should treat personal electronic data with the same care and respect as weapons-grade plutonium -- it is dangerous, long-lasting and once it has leaked, there's no getting it back.*

The goal of this training is to ensure that you understand the importance (and ways) of protecting sensitive data and apply it regularly both at your work and in your personal life. This training is important because it will educate you on:

1. Ways to prevent accidental and intentional misuse of sensitive data
2. Ways to make sensitive data secure without it being too onerous
3. The fact that it's not just about complying with some lengthy regulations - **it is about doing the right thing**. Our customers have entrusted us with their and their customers' sensitive data and we have a duty to protect that to the best of our abilities.
4. There are significant penalties associated with non-compliance to organizations and employees of those organizations. Lack of attention will impact not only us but our customers.

So please - take the time to read through this carefully.

*Organization of this tutorial*

We created this tutorial at Datica because we wanted something that we could distribute to all new hires to give them a crash course on HIPAA. While it's true there are plenty of HIPAA training options, both free and paid, we didn't feel that any were created for employees of modern health technology vendors. As we talked to early customers and prospects, we also realized that we were getting asked the same questions about HIPAA time and time again.

Seeing an opportunity to help the industry and ideally reduce the barriers to people coming into healthcare from outside the industry, both things we're passionate about at Datica, we decided to reuse some of our existing content, from our blog, and generate a bunch of new content. If you have feedback or suggestions, please [email][2] us.

We've tried to organize this in the most logical way possible. Each section below has multiple subsections, and we provide links to additional resources at the end. There is a quiz towards the end, which is meant to force you to actively engage, and break up the passive nature of the training.

Original material and content was created by [Datica Health, Inc,][3] and is released as open source. Available educational material for HIPAA is largely outdated in its coverage of technology and utility to vendors is extremely limited. The goal of releasing this as open source is that the growing community of healthcare companies can contribute, enrich, and keep it relevant over time. Please email [training@datica.com][4] with any questions or problems accessing the training.
