Lesson Content:

One of the most important aspects of HIPAA has nothing to do with technical security like encryption or backup or logging or any of other requirements for securing data. What’s important is what happens in the case of an unauthorized disclosure of ePHI, or a breach of ePHI.

A breach is defined as unauthorized exposure of ePHI or disclosure that’s not authorized or allowed under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The breach rules were amended in 2013 as part of the HITECH Act.

HIPAA requires notification of a breach “without unreasonable delay” but allows, at a maximum, 60 days to report a known breach.

**HIPAA Breaches**

One of the most important aspects of HIPAA has nothing to do with technical security like encryption or backup or logging or any of other requirements for securing data. What’s important is what happens in the case of an unauthorized disclosure of ePHI, or a breach of ePHI.

**Definition of Breach**

A breach is defined as unauthorized exposure of ePHI or disclosure that’s not authorized or allowed under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The breach rules were amended in 2013 as part of the HITECH Act.

HITECH Act Sec. 13402(b) Notification of Covered Entity by Business Associate states - A business associate of a covered entity that accesses, maintains, retains, modifies, records, stores, destroys, or otherwise holds, uses, or discloses unsecured protected health information shall, following the discovery of a breach of such information, notify the covered entity of such breach. Such notice shall include the identification of each individual whose unsecured protected health information has been, or is reasonably believed by the business associate to have been, accessed, acquired, or disclosed during such breach.

**Notifications**

HIPAA requires notification of a breach “without unreasonable delay” but allows, at a maximum, 60 days to report a known breach. Most covered entities that we’ve worked with want that timeline to be much shorter, and the range we usually hear is somewhere between 24 hours and 5 days. This can be a sticking point in business associate discussions. Some hosting providers have polices in place for breach reporting that are 30 days, 45 days, even 60 days out; this is typically not in line with what a hospital or a payer or another large enterprise in healthcare would expect from a business associate agreement and a breach policy for a business associate that they are working with. Despite the 60 day window HIPAA rules also go on to require “evidence demonstrating the necessity of any delay.” If it takes 60 days, there have to be reasons given for that delay.

Breach policy and breach notification are things that are extremely important. There are templates for breach notification, but the policy alone does not mitigate risk. There needs to be an understanding within the organization, business associate or covered entity, of what a breach is and what the breach policy is. There also need to be auditing and logging and other systems (IDS) in place to detect and investigate a breach. Detecting the breach is often the challenge which is why having a comprehensive audit log is necessary and more importantly, being able to generate alerts off the log is critical.
